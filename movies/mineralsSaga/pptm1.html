    <h1>Summary:</h1><br>
    <h2>After half of all life in the universe is snapped away by Thanos, Peppa Pig assembles a team of heroes (Normal Face, Steve, Marvin) to fight back.</h2><br><br>
    <h1>Notable characters:</h1><br>
    <h2>*Peppa Pig</h2><br>
    <h2>*Normal Face</h2><br>
    <h2>*Steve</h2><br>
    <h2>*Marvin</h2><br>
    <h2>*The Hamburglar</h2><br>
    <h2>*Thanos</h2><br>
    <h2>*Agent Blueberries (Unnamed; post-ending scene)</h2><br><br>
    <h1>Trivia:</h1><br>
    <h2>Originally, this was all there was. SuperNova28 has no intentions to make a sequel, let alone a whole cinematic universe. The cinematic universe idea was thought up during a school lunch where one of Nova's friends brought up the idea.</h2><br>
    <h2>Thanos doesn't use a single Infinity Stone power. He only uses his-as SuperNova28 calls it-"iconic giant purple f***ing fist".</h2><br>
    <h2>Everyone resurrected by Marvin was meant to join the Avengers, but SuperNova28 had other ideas for members and didn't want the roster getting too big.</h2><br>
    <h2>Hamburglar's betrayal was called "top 3 anime betrayals" by one of SuperNova28's IRL friends.</h2><br><br>
