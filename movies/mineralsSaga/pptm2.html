    <h1>Summary:</h1><br>
    <h2>After the fight with Thanos, the Avengers inadvertently created a rip in the multiverse. The rip caught the attention of the Multiverse Protection Agency, the governing body of the whole multiverse, and its sworn protectors; MPA Agent Blueberries was sent to assist the Avengers in repairing the rip.</h2><br><br>

    <h1>Trivia:</h1><br>
    <h2>Originally, the villain was named Peppa.AVI, who would've used her "epik demon powah!" to tear the multiverse apart. Was scrapped because it was a dumb idea; Nova thought it would make it <em>too</em> unserious.</h2><br>
    <h2>SuperNova28 considers this one to be her favorite due to "the mixture of the goofy charm the first 3 had, and seriousness".</h2><br>
    <h2>The MPA wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for this movie, as the entire reason the PPCU has a focus on the multiverse is because Nova thought it would be funny to reference "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness".</h2><br><br>
